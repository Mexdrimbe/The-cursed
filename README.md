# The Cursed

Welcome to `wtf.lua` — a chaotic experiment in entity manipulation for Red Dead Online scripting.

> This script shouldn't exist. But it does.  
> And it's beautiful.

## What is this?

A personal sandbox script made for fun, creativity, and testing limits within the RDO scripting environment.  
Spawns horses, mounts peds, clones the player, attaches mini-clones to their neck, triggers particle FX, and plays stacked animations.  
All wrapped in a toggle and cleaned up on exit. Controlled madness.

## Features

- Clone any target player
- Spawn a mount + attach them to it
- Attach mini-peds to the clone's body depending on gender
- Add fire particle effects under the mount
- Force animations on everything
- Auto-follow logic with reset buttons
- Text rendering on screen via system.tick
- Organized chaos via fallback logic and config functions

---

## Why?

Because Red Dead scripting is wild, and sometimes you just want to make a cursed masterpiece.  
This is not production code. It’s an *art piece* that demonstrates:

- Native control
- Ped configuration
- Bone-based attach logic
- Tick-driven visuals
- Real-time animation streaming and execution

## Notes

- Made by [Elton / CSN]
- Tested in Fortitude mod menu
- Don't copy blindly — learn from it or just laugh

## Disclaimer

This script is not meant to be used in serious environments.  
It's for testing, fun, and showcasing Lua-level control over Red Dead's entity systems.  
If you're reading this and still trying to figure it out — take a break. You’ve entered **The Cursed** zone.
